## Getting Started

You can fork this project onto your local machine. 
To create the project make sure you have Node installed and then NPM install the dependencies after you
create a new react redux app. Visit the react and redux documentation for that tutorial.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install Node on your machine to manage the dependencies. You will need a code editor like VS code for example.
You will need to create a react app. In your terminal you can start the production build and go from there.

### Installing

Some steps to get you started.

Create the react app with- create-react-app my-app  then cd my-app.

NPM start to make the development server run so you can see changes when you save.

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

 I installed the Jest testing library to make unit tests.

### Break down into end to end tests

Selenium was used to make end to end tests


### And coding style tests

## Versioning

For version control and versioning I used GIT and github. I also used Node package manager to manage the modules and check if they were running at the right version and current version if possible.
